## 1. Get Setup Tool
There are basically two ways to get the setup tool

### 1.1 Download the Binary Executable Directly
Check [vHive GitHub Repo](https://github.com/vhive-serverless/vHive/releases) for more details and choose the appropriate version to download.

### 1.2 Build from Source
**Building from source requires Go (version 1.19 at least) installed on your system.**
```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/vhive-serverless/vHive
cd vHive
pushd scripts && go build -o setup_tool && popd
```
Compiled executable file will be in the `scripts` directory.

## 2. Config the Setup Tool
**Normally, just skip this section and use the default config files** which are located in the `configs/setup` directory inside the [vHive repo](https://github.com/vhive-serverless/vHive).

- `configs/setup/knative.json`: knative related configs (all the path in the config file should be relative path inside the vHive repo)
- `configs/setup/kube.json`: Kubernetes related configs
- `configs/setup/system.json`: system related configs
- `configs/setup/vhive.json`: vHive related configs

You can modify the config files on your demand and then place all of them in one directory for the later use.

## 3. Use of Setup Tool
### 3.1 General Usage
```bash
./setup_tool [options] <subcommand> [parameters]
```
use the `-h` or `--help` option to look for the help
### 3.2 Specify Config Files
By default, the setup_tool will use the config files in `configs/setup` directory inside the vHive repo. 

To change the path of config files, use the `--setup-configs-dir` option to specify it.
```bash
./setup_tool --setup-configs-dir <CONFIG PATH> ...
```

### 3.3 Use with Local vHive Repo
By default, the setup_tool will check the current directory to ensure it is a vHive repo and then use it during the setup process.

To use other vHive repos locally, provide the `--vhive-repo-dir` option to specify it.
```bash
./setup_tool --vhive-repo-dir <VHIVE REPO PATH> ...
```

If the current directory or the provided path is not a valid vHive repo, the setup_tool will [automatically clone the remote vHive repo and use it](#34-use-with-remote-vhive-repo-standalone-use).

### 3.4 Use with Remote vHive Repo (Standalone Use)
When the setup_tool is directly downloaded or targeted for  standalone use, the setup_tool will automatically clone the remote vHive repo to the temporary directory and then use it during the setup process.

To change the URL and branch of the [default remote vHive repo](https://github.com/vhive-serverless/vHive), use `--vhive-repo-url` and `--vhive-repo-branch` options to specify them.
```bash
./setup_tool --vhive-repo-url <URL> --vhive-repo-branch <BRANCH> ...
``` 

Besides, when the current directory is a vHive repo or the `--vhive-repo-dir` option is valid, **the local repo will be prioritized for use**. **To force the setup_tool to clone and use the remote vHive repo**, provide `--force-remote` option to the setup_tool.
```bash
./setup_tool --force-remote ...
```


### 3.5 Migrate from Legacy Shell Scripts
Just type the name of the original shell script and append corresponding parameters behind. For example:
```bash
# Legacy ==>
scripts/cloudlab/setup_node.sh stock-only
# ==> Current
./setup_tool [options] setup_node stock-only

# Legacy ==>
scripts/create_devmapper.sh
# ==> Current
./setup_tool [options] create_devmapper

# Legacy ==>
scripts/gpu/setup_nvidia_gpu.sh
# ==> Current
./setup_tool [options] setup_nvidia_gpu
```

**NOTICE**: Shell scripts in `scripts/stargz`, `scripts/self-hosted-kind`, and `scripts/github_runner` **are not supported to be invoked in this way at present**.


## 4. Logs
The log files will be named as `<subcommand>_common.log` and `<subcommand>_error.log`. All log files will be stored in the directory where the setup_tool is executed.

- `<subcommand>_common.log`: all output originally writes to `stdout` will be redirected to this log file.
- `<subcommand>_error.log`: all output originally writes to `stderr` will be redirected to this log file.

## 5. Supported Platform
At present, only `Ubuntu 20.04 (amd64)` is officially tested. Other versions of `Ubuntu` may also work, but not guaranteed.
